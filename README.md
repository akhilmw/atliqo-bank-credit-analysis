## 🔍 Key Insights & Tasks

### ✅ **Phase 1: Exploratory Data Analysis**

- 📊 Performed EDA on customer & transaction data
- 🧹 Cleaned data: removed nulls, treated outliers using IQR
- 📈 Visualized trends using histograms, box plots, bar plots, and pie charts
- 📐 Calculated central tendency & dispersion metrics (mean, median, std. dev)
- 🤝 Merged customer and transaction datasets
- 📦 Segmented data by platform, product category, payment type, age group, and marital status
- 🎯 Identified 18–25 age group as most promising based on usage behavior

### ✅ **Phase 2: Statistical Testing**

- 📊 Applied **Central Limit Theorem** to sample distribution
- 🧪 Conducted **Z-Test** to statistically test if the 18–25 age group truly shows higher engagement/suitability
- 📉 p-value and z-score confirmed the significance of the result
- ✅ **Hypothesis testing validated that the 18–25 age group is significantly more likely to benefit from the credit product**
